Game Developer (Intern),VividChain,Berlin,,Yes,,,"Are you a young coding talent with ambitions to develop games?  Do you have first mobile dev experiences and want to proof and improve them?  Then we are looking for you at vividchain in Berlin!   **   The goal of vividchain is to create apps and games that have a positive impact on society. In particular, we want to let our users connect with the real world around them, eg. to get to know other users in real life. In 2019, vividchain will launch “Scoutside”: The first geolocation-based social game that actually enables for real social activities. Imagine if Pokémon Go players and alike would not just walk to the same Points of Interests, but also would like to actively collaborate with other players, eg. to talk to each other and to trade ingame resources. We want mobile games to become possible entry points for social interactions (instead of being spaces that isolate people and lock their gaze at the screen).  Right now, we conduct first user tests and focus on making “Scoutside” a unique experience that - better than incumbents - accompanies the player on his/her daily travel routes.  To support our current team and to speed up our production time we are looking for a Game Development Intern.  Join our mission and help us making “Scoutside” a worldwide success story!   What we offer:  Top mentoring: You will closely work together with experts and acquire new skills on a daily basis.  High responsibility: You will be enabled to become a pivotal part of our core development team.  Paid internships: No matter if your internship is mandatory or not - your output will be valued.  The chance to actually do something good: “Scoutside” is meant to actually connect people. It might become THE mobile game that initially kicks off real multiplayer interactions in GPS-based games!  An aspiring team with an inspiring vision: We are game designers, communication designers, entrepreneurs, psychologists, free artists, and much more. We love diversity and rethink the role which digital games could fulfill in our society.   What we expect:  You are excited about “Scoutside” and are willing to create a great and unique experience that might change the way we play GPS-based games. You are both, self-reliant and communicative. You bring first valuable experience with Game Programming as well as Mobile Development. You already have worked in teams and know common tools and workflows (eg. git). First expertises in these fields are a plus: Backend Handling, BaaS (esp. Firebase) Mobile Development (responsive UI / Frontend; Performance Optimization) Unit/Integration Tests and Test-Driven Development Graphic Programming (esp. Shader) Technical Art (Texture Handling, VFX,..) (Rapid) Game Prototyping (esp. in Unity) Your English is excellent; German skills are a plus.   Attitude before Skill:  We are looking for creative talents, fast learners, spirited pioneers. If you are not familiar with one or two aspects, we still might want to meet you. Just show us your passion, ambition, skills and previous works!  Sounds good?",,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=afa5fa7c8b39ee2c&from=vj&pos=top,indeed,vor 30+ Tagen,2019-10-25
